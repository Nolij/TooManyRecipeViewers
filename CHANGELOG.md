- replace ingredient manager
- add hidden ingredient, recipe, & category support
- use EMI API for alias registration (EMI >=1.1.20 is now required due to this change)
- changed how recipe IDs are generated (this should result in less duplicates at the cost of unfortunately all previously generated recipe IDs being invalidated)
- further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience
