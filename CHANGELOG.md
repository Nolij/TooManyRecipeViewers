- add (partial) support for `IRecipeCategory.createRecipeExtras()` (this should fix scroll grid widgets)
- add support for smithing recipe category extensions
- fix recipe transfer handlers
- further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience
