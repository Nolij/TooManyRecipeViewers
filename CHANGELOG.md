- added error ingredient for conversion failures so broken recipes can be more easily identified and reported
- use `EmiIngredient` instead of cycling slot widgets (this requires removing support for renderer overrides but greatly improves usability in other ways)
- further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience
